Disco Elysium is an isometric role-playing game first released in October 2019, later rereleased as a free update as Disco Elysium - The Final Cut in March 2021
The world of Elysium was first created as a high fantasy setting for use in a pen-and-paper tabletop RPG spanning several campaigns, having started as a collection of ideas and a "paracosm" by Disco Elysium lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and his friends when they were teenagers in the early 2000s. They would eventually get rid of the pseudo-medieval and pseudo-renaissance trappings typical of the fantasy genre as well as a industrial revolution version (at some point, Elysium was a steampunk setting inspired by the French Revolution), turning them into historical periods within the setting, and replacing it with a modern fantasy world, a fantasy world in its modernity, which roughly corresponds to the middle part of our 20th century. A genre that can best be described as "modernopunk". Kurvitz would publish the first official work set in Elysium in 2013, a novel titled Sacred and Terrible Air (Püha ja õudne lõhn in the original Estonian), set after the events of Disco Elysium.

Set in a universe of "fantastic realism", Elysium is a world with a six thousand years of history, spanning from its own version of the early Bronze Age (Perikarnassian period) to the early Middle Ages (Franconigerian period) to the Renaissance (Dolorian period) right up to a decade called the "Seventies".Elysium is made up of seven known landmasses of matter called "Isolas" (from "isolation") separated by vast stretches of literal nothingness called the Pale, an anti-reality mist-like mass in which the laws of reality break down and can drive a human insane. The isolas are made up of various states, nations, and continents such as Meteo, Vesper, Graad, and Vaasa. Another feature of Elysium is the innocentic system, a legitimate and operative "religion of history", in which an exceptional person is elected and declared to be the highest category of historical personage in the world, an embodiment of the World Spirit and literal personification of History.

Disco Elysium is set in the district of Martinaise, in and around Terminal B of the Greater Revachol Industrial Harbour, both located in West Revachol, in the Insulinde isola, and taking place in the year '51 of the Current Century.
